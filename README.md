# DSP_custom
C-based/C++-based Digital Signal Processing Library 


# Abstract 

The focus of this libary is to include C and C++ implimentations of different signal processing techniques for later use in custom audio devices.

Ideally all of the below will be supported:
* FFT
* Low and High Pass filters
* Equilization
* Compression
* Reverb
* Delay
* Gain


Current Implimenation Includes:
* Low, High, Bandpass, and Bandstop filters (time and frequency domain)
* FFT (Tukey-Cooler) and inverse FFT

# Development 
Initially the library was created with the intention of remainining completely in C and to not support C++, however, due to a desire to practice and learn more about object oriented design and C++ as a whole the main development was swapped.
